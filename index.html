                <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Your Resume</h2>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">It's part life story, and part sales pitch: your resume will be a summary of everything you've done that makes you worth hiring. Recruiters from potential employers will use your resume as a representation of what you can provide to their company and base many of their considerations on what's included on that page. That's why having a good resume is critical, so when the career fair rolls around, you'll have made improvements and additions that will make it even better.
					<br/><br/>Your resume will consist of three main parts about yourself that we'll walk you through:</h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row text-center">
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <span class="fa-stack fa-4x">
                        <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary"></i>
                        <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-stack-1x fa-inverse" style="margin-left: 2px;"></i>
                    </span>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Education</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">As a student in UTCS, one of the top CS programs in the world, you're already getting your foot in the door with many companies looking for future interns and employees. You'll need to include that you're currently attending the University of Texas at Austin, are studying Computer Science, and the year you expect to graduate. Additionally, you should list out the names of the CS-relevant courses you're currently taking. <i>For example:</i></p>
					<div class="example-block">
						<b>Attending the University of Texas at Austin</b><br/>
						Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Expected Graduation: 2019<br/>
						Currently taking: Introduction to Programming
					</div>
					<p class="text-muted">Although it can be tempting to write in your High School alongside UT, it is far less significant than your college education and should be left off. However, you should include any awards or honors you earned while attending High School - those can help highlight your accomplishments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <span class="fa-stack fa-4x">
                        <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary"></i>
                        <i class="fa fa-building fa-stack-1x fa-inverse" style="margin-left: 2px;"></i>
                    </span>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Experience</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">You'll face a lot of fierce competition from other students as you search for internship positions, and your prior experience is what will make you stand out. What are some cool, unique, or interesting CS-relevant projects you've worked on in the past few years? Have you done programming work for a company or volunteer organization in the past? The Experience section stands as a summary of your involvement in CS outside of school.
					<br/><br/> Not only should you mention who you were, but what you did, and even how you did it. Action verbs - created, developed, integrated, optimized, etc. - are you friend here, and make it apparent what specifically your role was in each bit you mention.</p>
					<div class="example-block">
						<b>2018 - ToasterTech Software Developer</b><br/>
						Devised a pattern-matching algorithm to predict the desired toasting time for bread depending on measured thickness, weight, and time of day.
					</div>
					<p class="text-muted">Avoid inserting irrelevant work experience, such as working for a grocery store or restaurant, unless you were in a high-level position (such as a team lead or manager role) that could provide evidence for soft skills (like communication, work ethic, or time management).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <span class="fa-stack fa-4x">
                        <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary"></i>
                        <i class="fa fa-terminal fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
                    </span>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Skills</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">As a CS student, your experience with various programming languages such as Python, Java, or C will make you stand out amongst other applicants. You’ll want to include the ones that you have experience with, and indicate the level of experience you have with each (expert, proficient, or familiar). You should include Web markup languages like HTML/CSS. <i>The levels of experience are defined as follows:</i><br/>
					<ul class="skills-list">
						<li><b>Expert:</b> You can write complex and effective code in your sleep, and rarely have to look up specific syntax.</li>
						<li><b>Proficient:</b> You can write general, usable code for the language, but occasionally require the assistance of an external source for guidance.</li>
						<li><b>Familiar/Exposure To:</b> You can read and understand most of the language, but have difficulty writing code from scratch.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="text-muted">Here's what you might write:</p>
					<div class="example-block">
						<b>Languages:</b> Proficient in Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS <br/>Exposure to C++, and Assembly
					</div>

                                    <h3>Which companies hire Freshmen students?</h3>
                                    <p>Companies hiring freshmen are usually looking for those currently enrolled in Data Structures. Data Structures serves as the doorway to many possible internships that the companies offer. If you have credit for Introduction to Programming, and are looking to find an internship during your freshman year, it is advised that you petition for the credit. Students should do intensive research on the different companies that attend in order to prepare for possible interviews. These interviews are very professional and competitive; therefore, you must do your best to gain recognition. </p>
                                    <h3>Which companies are good to talk to?</h3>
                                    <p>Some well known companies are Microsoft, Apple, Google, Dell, and Intel, to name a few. These companies are good to talk to if you are interested in software development, innovation, research, and mobile technologies.</p>
                                    <p>Usually, students want to be noticed by these companies because of their culture, pay, work environment, and size. Your competition, however, is quite large due to their popularity. Be sure to also consider smaller startups, or less well known companies, which will not only have less competitio, but will have shorter lines and more time with recruiters at the career fair. Regardless of whether or not you think you have a chance with a company, you should still talk to them to gain information about the various opportunities they offer.</p>
                                    <h3>Have some company profiles:</h3>

                                            You’ve already heard that for the Career Fair you will need to dress business casual. “Business Casual” is a bit of a vague term that is defined as :
                                            “relating to or denoting a style of clothing that is less formal than traditional business wear, but is still intended to give a professional and businesslike impression.”
                                            Now it’s obvious that you will need to dress formally for this event, but how much? The key to dressing properly come down to these 5 principles.

						All done constructing your resume? Great, but you’re not quite done yet! Before you hand out resumes with typos to future employers, you’ll need someone to review your resume to take it to the next level.

There are many ways you can have your resume reviewed on campus, and there are many free resources that you can take advantage of:
