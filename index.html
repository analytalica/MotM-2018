                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">It's part life story, and part sales pitch: your resume will be a summary of everything you've done that makes you worth hiring. Recruiters from potential employers will use your resume as a representation of what you can provide to their company and base many of their considerations on what's included on that page. That's why having a good resume is critical, so when the career fair rolls around, you'll have made improvements and additions that will make it even better.
                            <br/><br/>Your resume will consist of three main parts about yourself that we'll walk you through:

You'll need to include that you're currently attending the University of Texas at Austin, are studying Computer Science, and the year you expect to graduate. Additionally, you should list out the names of the CS-relevant courses you're currently taking. <i>For example:</i></p>
                        <div class="example-block">
                            <b>Attending the University of Texas at Austin</b><br/>

However, you should include any awards or honors you earned while attending High School - those can help highlight your accomplishments.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">

                        <p class="text-muted">You'll face a lot of fierce competition from other students as you search for internship positions, and your prior experience is what will make you stand out. What are some cool, unique, or interesting CS-relevant projects you've worked on in the past few years? Have you done programming work for a company or volunteer organization in the past? The Experience section stands as a summary of your involvement in CS outside of school.
                            <br/><br/> Not only should you mention who you were, but what you did, and even how you did it. Action verbs - created, developed, integrated, optimized, etc. - are you friend here, and make it apparent what specifically your role was in each bit you mention.
                        </p>

You’ll want to include the ones that you have experience with, and indicate the level of experience you have with each (expert, proficient, or familiar). You should include Web markup languages like HTML/CSS. <i>The levels of experience are defined as follows:</i><br/>

                            <li><b>Expert:</b> You can write complex and effective code in your sleep, and rarely have to look up specific syntax.</li>

                            <li><b>Familiar/Exposure To:</b> You can read and understand most of the language, but have difficulty writing code from scratch.</li>

                                <p>The Career fair is where students and faculty can look for potential employers to work for and to look for potential interns. The career fair is for all students in the natural sciences college at UT. There are a variety of employers and interns that are seeking candidates for full-time, part-time, and internship positions. The career fair EXPO is generally held in the fall and in the spring. If you are looking for a job or an internship, then the career fair is the place to look!</p>

                                <p>Some well known companies are Microsoft, Apple, Google, Dell, and Intel, to name a few. These companies are good to talk to if you are interested in software development, innovation, research, and mobile technologies.</p>
                                <p>Usually, students want to be noticed by these companies because of their culture, pay, work environment, and size. Your competition, however, is quite large due to their popularity. Be sure to also consider smaller startups, or less well known companies, which will not only have less competitio, but will have shorter lines and more time with recruiters at the career fair. Regardless of whether or not you think you have a chance with a company, you should still talk to them to gain information about the various opportunities they offer.</p>

                                    You’ve already heard that for the Career Fair you will need to dress business casual. “Business Casual” is a bit of a vague term that is defined as :
                                    “relating to or denoting a style of clothing that is less formal than traditional business wear, but is still intended to give a professional and businesslike impression.”

                            All done constructing your resume? Great, but you’re not quite done yet! Before you hand out resumes with typos to future employers, you’ll need someone to review your resume to take it to the next level. The first resume you make will likely be loaded with errors or rookie mistakes (no offense), and this can give recruiters the impression that you’re inexperienced or underqualified. There are many ways you can have your resume reviewed on campus, and there are many free resources that you can take advantage of:
